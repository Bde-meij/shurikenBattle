This game is a standalone extract from the 'transcendence' website project
elsewhere on my github

to run the game, first install 'nodejs'
this can be done in several ways and depends on your system

after that cd to this directory and do

'npm install'
then
'npm run'

when done the game should be running on 
"http://localhost:1234" in your browser!

goal of the game is to hit the boss (big blob in the middle of the screen)
with the 'shuriken'

use 'A' and 'D' to turn the paddles counterclockwise and clockwise respectively
and use them to bounce the shuriken towards the middle

to restart the game refresh the page

have fun!
